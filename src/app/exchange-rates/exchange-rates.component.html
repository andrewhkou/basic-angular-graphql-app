<p>This component is made by me! The information below is queried from a GraphQL server that gave me exchange rates:</p>

<div *ngIf="loading">
    Loading...
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="error">
    Error :(
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="rates">
    <div *ngFor="let rate of rates">
      <p>{{rate.currency}}: {{rate.rate}}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
